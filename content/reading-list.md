This will serve as a rolling archive of the books I have read, when I read them, and any reflections I had while reading.


* **The Naked Sun - Isaac Asimov (1957)**
    * ISBN `0-553-29339-7`
    * Read Summer 2023
    * I read this book a while ago so my thoughts on it are kind of rusty. I found this book to be really eye opening especially with the context of the pandemic. A persistent theme of the book is more and more of people's daily lives being facilitated by robots, resulting in a society which practices extremely germaphobic behaviors including only communicating via video conferencing; a striking parallel to society during the 2020 pandemic, except replace a 1950s interpretation of Zoom with... Zoom. I found it profound how Asimov is able to see into the future with such clarity, but I guess sci-fi tends to *feel* that way.
