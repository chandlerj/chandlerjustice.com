<p>The amount of customization available on a Linux desktop absolutely scratches my OCD. I sometimes find myself spending hours tweaking
every aspect of the system I can. Every program that dropped a file in my <code>.config</code> folder was a new present, where I could dive in
and change every last variable of a configuration value. Beyond scratching an itch, tweaking a program&rsquo;s config file is a great way
to learn how that program works and how to use that program.</p>
<p>Eventually I realized my process for theming programs could be boiled down to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a wallpaper I like</li>
<li>Pull out a color picker and find colors
I liked from the image</li>
<li>Use those colors as a palette and go through every
configuration file replacing the colors throughout
the configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>I then remembered that I knew how to code and could automate this process!</p>
<h2 id="using-k-means-clustering-to-get-colors">Using K-Means Clustering to Get Colors</h2>
<p>The K-Means algorithm is a way of finding a defined number of points <code>n</code>, that exists in a dataset of <code>k</code> elements. As elements are observed they are assigned to one of the points, and the points value is modified to be the mean of all points associated with it.</p>
<p>I tried finding a <em>scholarly</em> article that summarizes the math behind
K-Means clustering I could site, but Wikipedia ended up having the most
digestible explanation.</p>
<p>Given observations</p>
<p>$$(x_1, x_2, &hellip;, x_n), \quad x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$$</p>
<p>Partition the elements into sets</p>
<p>$$S = (S_1, S_2, &hellip;, S_k)$$</p>
<p>and minimize the within-cluster sum of squares</p>
<p>$$arg_s min \sum^{k}_{i=1} \sum_x^{S_i} ||x - \mu_i||^2, \quad \mu_i = \frac{1}{len(S_i)} \sum^{S_i}_x x $$</p>
