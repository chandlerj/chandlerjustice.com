      <description>This semester was a lot of fun for me. I am going to go through some of the highlights and lowlights of this last semester in anticipation of the upcoming semester. I also completed all the requirements for my Bachelors in Computer Science, so from here on out all my coursework will be towards completing my second degree in Computational Math.&#xA;CS5030: High Performance Computing Taught by Dr. Steve Patruzza This class was a blast and goes head first into high performance computing and the best practices when utilizing a computing cluster.</description>
